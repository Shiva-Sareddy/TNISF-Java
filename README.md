### Hi, I'm Shiva Sareddy! 👋

💡 I’m currently enrolled in the **C2TC program** under **TNSIF**, a foundation supported by **Capgemini**. This program offers an exciting journey for final-year students, covering:

- 🗄️ **SQL**
- ☕ **Java**
- 🎨 **Frontend Development**
- 🌿 **Spring 5.0**, **Hibernate**
- 💻 **Git**

🗓️ The course kicked off on **27th August 2024** and will run for about 4-6 months, providing a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into these technologies while opening up placement prospects for us. 

⚡ I’m passionate about building efficient solutions, and I’m excited to apply what I learn in real-world projects.
